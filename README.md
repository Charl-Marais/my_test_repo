# Test Project to test external pipelines

We will test the GitLab external pipeline process

- This seems to require manual configuration of the 2 webhooks
- Is there still a delay?

Does updating the mirror result in a pipeline trigger?
- Have now disabled the build mirror flag so it should not build
- Deleted the ci file
- Disabled project builds on Gitlab
- No pipeline created but re-enabled it
- testing again
- and again
- again
- yes again
- You guessed it again
- another sanity check
- now its not working
- yip again
- I expect the pipeline to still be triggered despite being false
- Of course I would not be done with the as yet. Always another thing around the corner.
- checking if updating via the console changes things.
- another test
- yet another test
- test with policy enabled
- testing agin
- one more go
- adding this via a branch
- test umpteenth time
- making some thing new
- Trying once more
- Updating policy to include only when there mirror_user is not making the request
