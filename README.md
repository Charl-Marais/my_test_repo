# Test Project to test external pipelines

We will test the GitLab external pipeline process

- This seems to require manual configuration of the 2 webhooks
- Is there still a delay?

Does updating the mirror result in a pipeline trigger?
- Have now disabled the build mirror flag so it should not build
- Deleted the ci file
- Disabled project builds on Gitlab
